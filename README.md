# Dawn-of-Conquest briefing
Hey guys, this is the Dawn-of-Conquest repository...
Basically we can add in branches, the main branch is called
"Master" which will have all the main stuff and final stuff
in it...
The other branches  will have the code that we may or may not
implement to the final product.
the master folder is the final product folder - if that makes sense... 
(When your done with a sub-project or a piece of code and it
works then you need to "commit" it then it will go into the master folder)

Pre-alpha concept of Dawn of conquest:
Instead of just earning money we get
- Defence gains
- Strategic gains
- Weapon stash gains
- Combat gains
- Expanding town
- Trading towns
- There'll be two main stats that will measure how much your town
earns and what your main town score is.

The computer will randomly generate battles
during the week which will effect your soldiers,
weapon stash and defence gains.
